This project was created as part of my studies in the Master's program in Cybersecurity at Sup de Vinci Paris. The assignment was to create a toolbox for conducting automated penetration tests. This toolbox aims to simplify and streamline the process of identifying vulnerabilities in network systems.

## Prerequisites for Windows

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following software on your system:

- Python 3.11 or later. You can download the latest version of Python here: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Nmap, a network discovery and security auditing tool. You can install Nmap by visiting [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/) and following the instructions for your operating system.

## Installation

To download the repository, you can follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using Git

If you have Git installed on your computer, you can clone the repository directly to your local machine. Here's how to do it:

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Choose a location on your computer where you want to clone the repository.
Run the following command:
